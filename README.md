## Description

This project is part of a larger application.
The application's assumption is to create a system that will display a question and answer window during transmission. The user will be able to mark the correct answer in his opinion. After the allotted time has elapsed, the correct answer will appear and if the user has responded well he will score points.

This project creates functionality that allows displaying a window with a question and answers, which are downloaded every 30 seconds using the REST API. After the time for response has elapsed, the window is hidden. When the user answers the question before the time runs out, the window will disappear after 2 seconds.
